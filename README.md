# 04 - Angular - The Directives

.Challenge {

  To achieve this challenge, leave the Angular app that you created in the previous quest .

  The goal of this challenge is to create a list of movies (you can get inspired by it ), whose display depends on two         directives. 

  * We want the first element of your list to change style on the flyover. For that, create a new CSS class (which defines a     color and a text size, for example), then apply it to your HTML element via a custom attribute directive of your own.
  * Creates a custom structural directive that allows the display of the list only if a variable showMovieshas value true.
  * Post the link to your repository as a solution.
